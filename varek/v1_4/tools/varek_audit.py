varek_audit.py — re-check a saved Warden verdict stream against its policy
(v1.15), and verify that the stream is the one the Warden wrote (v1.16).

Every file open the Warden authorized carries a certificate (the deciding rule
and a witness), which the Warden's in-line checker accepted before the open
took effect. This tool repeats that check later, from the saved stream and the
policy file alone:

  1. The stream is authenticated as varek_cyclonedx.py does (run id, gap-free
     seq, run_end count, and from v1.16 the hash chain), so the supervised
     AGENT cannot have added, dropped or forged a record.
  1a. v1.16, against whoever HOLDS the log: with --pubkey (the Warden's
     --sign-key public half, from tools/varek_keygen), every signature in the
     stream must verify under that key, and a complete stream must end in a
     signed run_end. Nobody without the private key can then alter, add,
     remove or reorder a record before the last signature, or cut the stream
     short. With --anchor (the Warden's --anchor file, kept where the log's
     holder cannot rewrite it), every signed record in the stream must appear
     in the anchor and every anchored record of this run must appear in the
     stream: history that reached the anchor cannot be rewritten even by the
     key holder. Signatures are verified by tools/varek_ed25519.py (RFC 8032,
     pure Python), not by the library that made them.
  2. The policy file given here must hash to the policy_sha256 in run_start:
     the certificates are checked against exactly the text the Warden used.
  3. The only authorizations are certified file opens and the agent's one
     launch exec: any other record that reads ALLOW fails the audit.
  4. Every authorized file open must carry a certificate the checker accepted
     in-line ("check":"ok"), and every such certificate is re-checked now by
     the certificate checker (tools/vdp_cert_check, the same small program the
     Warden runs; it shares no code with the decision procedure).
  5. A stream from the test-only fault-injected Warden is refused.

Exit 0 only if all of these hold. The verdict stream is the Warden's stderr
(`warden policy -- agent 2> verdicts.log`). The report's "integrity" line says
how far the stream is protected against its holder: "none" (pre-1.16),
"chain" (edits caught only if the editor did not recompute the chain),
"signed, key not pinned" (pass --pubkey to rely on it), "signed" and
"signed, anchored".
